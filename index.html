<h2 id="one">Rabbits &#128007</h2>
<p>Rabbits are the first pets I've had when I was a kid. As we kept shifting we had gave the rabbit back to its owner. When years passed by during pandemic lockdown we got a pair of Rabbits which were imported from New Zealand. One had black eyes and another had red eyes. One day tragedy takes place, there heavy thunderstorm in night we were unaware until morning. When we woke up one rabit was dead and another after two hours it passed away due to anxiety of losing its partner. <b><i>They were so attached to each other that they came together during death too.</i></b></p>

<h2 id="two">Turtle &#128034; </h2>
<p>During pandemic when we bought rabit at the same time we had bought a red slider turtle. After not finding a perfect name which suits our turtle I decided to name him as <b>"Mr.TURTLEHEAD"</b>. Mr. Turtlehead has been a part of our life since three years. Looking forward to spening more 50 years of its lifespan with us.</p>

<h2 id="three">Fishes &#128032; </h2>
<p>I am not a fan of keeping fishes in aquarium as I'm a non-vegitarian. But as my vegan mom who loves fishes and believes in superstitions my dad keeps bringing keep home. It gets awkward whenever I order fish fry and look at the aquarium. </p>

<h2 id="four">Parrot &#129436;</h2>
<p>There was a wounded broken wing parrot in our field my dad rescued it and bought it home to take care of it till it flies. Although after a monthh it started walking it was'nt able to fly properly. Even though we kept the balcony open it used to come back home,cut to two years it had started calling my name. I grew attached to it. During my college days when I was absent and when my family bought anew puppy home. The parrot attacked it multiple times and started screaming everyday. One day during my absence my dad left the parrot in lake for it to finally return to its home where it belongs in nature. Hoping, that it survived and it is in better place. </p>

<h2 id="five">Dog &#128021;</h2>
<p>Best thing that has happend to me. During my dad's birthday we bought home our new family member <b>Leo</b>. From giving up for months taking care of him, my parent grew attached to him. Leo is one year and 3 months now. From never being a emotional person till After Leo came to life I started crying for every sad clips of dogs growing old. He is the reason I always look forward to coming home early any vacation. The quote <b>"Dogs are a human's bestfriend"</b> I got to see it in realtime.</p>
